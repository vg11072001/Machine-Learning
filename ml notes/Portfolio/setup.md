Factors to consider when choosing a budget GPU:
VRAM (Video RAM):
Aim for at least 4GB of VRAM for basic machine learning tasks, but more is needed for larger models and datasets. 
CUDA cores:
Check the number of CUDA cores on the GPU as they directly impact processing power. 
Compatibility:
Ensure your chosen GPU is compatible with your operating system and machine learning frameworks.
