# ## A short introduction to PyTorch-Ignite (Online Bonus Content)

# In this section, we will explore PyTorch-Ignite, a library from the PyTorch ecosystem to help with training and evaluating neural networks in PyTorch flexibly and transparently. 
# 
# 
# **Projects using PyTorch-Ignite**
# 
# 
# There is a list of research papers with code, blog articles, tutorials, toolkits, and other projects that use PyTorch-Ignite. Notable projects include
# - Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI) (https://monai.io) 
# - Conversational AI with Transfer Learning (https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai)

# As we saw in previous sections, PyTorch training code usually contains two nested for-loops, one iterating over epochs and one iterating over dataset batches. In addition, we evaluate the model on the training and validation set to track the performance during training. In general, we also would like to create training checkpoints (to resume from one in case of an accidental failure); save the best model; use an experiment tracking system to visualize metrics, predictions, and so forth; and perform other basic tasks. These are the kinds of things that PyTorch-Ignite easily handles for the user while keeping PyTorch-like flexibility. In this sense, PyTorch-Ignite aims to simplify the model training process while promoting best practices. 
# 
# In a few words, PyTorch-Ignite provides 
# - An extremely simple engine and event system (training loop abstraction)
# - Out-of-the-box metrics to easily evaluate models
# - Built-in handlers to compose training pipelines, save artifacts, and log parameters and metrics
# - Distributed training support
# 
# Additional benefits of using PyTorch-Ignite are 
# - Less code than pure PyTorch while ensuring maximum control and simplicity
# - More modular code
# In this section, we will build and train again a classifier for the MNIST dataset that we worked with in the previous section.

# ### Setting up the PyTorch model

# First, to set the stage, we will repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 from the section *Project two - classifying MNIST handwritten digits with minor restructuring*. We define the model, training, and validation datasets, optimizer, and loss function: 



 
 
 
image_path = './' 
torch.manual_seed(1) 
 
transform = transforms.Compose([ 
    transforms.ToTensor() 
]) 
 
 
mnist_train_dataset = MNIST( 
    root=image_path,  
    train=True,
    transform=transform,  
    download=True
) 
 
mnist_val_dataset = MNIST( 
    root=image_path,  
    train=False,  
    transform=transform,  
    download=False 
) 
 
batch_size = 64
train_loader = DataLoader( 
    mnist_train_dataset, batch_size, shuffle=True 
) 
 
val_loader = DataLoader( 
    mnist_val_dataset, batch_size, shuffle=False 
) 
 
 
def get_model(image_shape=(1, 28, 28), hidden_units=(32, 16)): 
    input_size = image_shape[0] * image_shape[1] * image_shape[2] 
    all_layers = [nn.Flatten()]
    for hidden_unit in hidden_units: 
        layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_unit) 
        all_layers.append(layer) 
        all_layers.append(nn.ReLU()) 
        input_size = hidden_unit 
 
    all_layers.append(nn.Linear(hidden_units[-1], 10)) 
    all_layers.append(nn.Softmax(dim=1)) 
    model = nn.Sequential(*all_layers)
    return model 
 
 
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
 
model = get_model().to(device)
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# As you can see, the code above only relies on PyTorch concepts we that we already introduced previously. Via the `get_model()` function, we define a reusable function to conveniently create a multilayer perceptron with a user-defined number of hidden layers, where each hidden layer is followed by a ReLU activation. The output layer is followed by a Softmax layer.
# 
# Note that the MNIST dataset does not have a pre-defined validation set split. For simplicity, we assigned the test dataset as the validation set for simplicity. However, if we use the validation set for model selection, it does not provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.

# ### Setting up training and validation engines with PyTorch-Ignite

# When we are done setting up the most important parts, PyTorch-Ignite will handle all other boilerplate code. Next, we have to define a trainer engine by passing our model, optimizer, and loss function to the `ignite.engine.create_supervised_trainer()` function for creating a trainer object that is used to train supervised models conveniently (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.engine.create_supervised_trainer.html). In addition, we create an *evaluator* engine by passing PyTorch-Igniteâ€™s out-of-the-box metrics and the model to the `ignite.engine.create_supervised_evaluator()` function (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.engine.create_supervised_evaluator.html#create-supervised-evaluator): 



 
 
trainer = create_supervised_trainer(
    model, optimizer, loss_fn, device=device
)
 
val_metrics = {
    "accuracy": Accuracy(),
    "loss": Loss(loss_fn)
}
 
evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(
    model, metrics=val_metrics, device=device
)


# Both the `trainer` and `evaluator` objects are instances of the `Engine` class (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.engine.engine.Engine.html#ignite.engine.engine.Engine), which is one of the core components of PyTorch-Ignite. It is essentially an abstraction over the training or validation loops.

# ### Creating event handlers for logging and validation

# We can customize the code further by adding all kinds of event handlers. `Engine` allows adding handlers for various events that are triggered during the run. When an event is triggered, the attached handlers (functions) are executed. Thus, for logging purposes, we add a function that will be executed at the end of every `log_interval` iteration:



# How many batches to wait before logging training status
log_interval = 100
 
@trainer.on(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED(every=log_interval))
def log_training_loss():
    e = trainer.state.epoch
    max_e = trainer.state.max_epochs
    i = trainer.state.iteration
    batch_loss = trainer.state.output
    print(f"Epoch[{e}/{max_e}], Iter[{i}] Loss: {batch_loss:.2f}")


# Or, equivalently, without the decorator, we can attach the handler function to the trainer via an `add_event_handler()` call (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.engine.engine.Engine.html#ignite.engine.engine.Engine.add_event_handler).
# 
# Similar to creating an event handler for logging the training status that we created above, we can create an event handler for computing validation metrics after each epoch.
# Via the following code, we will run the `evaluator` on the validation set data loader, `val_loader`, when an epoch completes:



@trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
def log_validation_results():
    eval_state = evaluator.run(val_loader)
    metrics = eval_state.metrics
    e = trainer.state.epoch
    max_e = trainer.state.max_epochs
    acc = metrics['accuracy']
    avg_loss = metrics['loss']
    print(f"Validation Results - Epoch[{e}/{max_e}] Avg Accuracy: {acc:.2f} Avg Loss: {avg_loss:.2f}")


# ### Setting up training checkpoints and saving the best model

# It is a common practice to save the trainer, model, optimizer, and other related objects during the training process. This allows us to resume the model training from the checkpoint in case of an accidental training interruption. We will use an out-of-the-box PyTorch-Ignite handler to set up a training checkpointing for each epoch:



 
# We will save in the checkpoint the following:
to_save = {"model": model, "optimizer": optimizer, "trainer": trainer}
 
# We will save checkpoints to the local disk
output_path = "./output"
save_handler = DiskSaver(dirname=output_path, require_empty=False)
 
# Set up the handler:
checkpoint_handler = Checkpoint(
    to_save, save_handler, filename_prefix="training")

# Attach the handler to the trainer
trainer.add_event_handler(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED, checkpoint_handler)


# Via the code above, we created a `Checkpoint` object (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.handlers.checkpoint.Checkpoint.html#ignite.handlers.checkpoint.Checkpoint), which allows us to save and load a model later.
# 
# Besides saving models to be able to resume an interrupted training run, we are primarily interested in saving the best model, for example, for making predictions later during the inference stage. We can then load a saved model via `torch.load` as explained in the section Saving and reloading the trained model in *Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch*.
# 
# Usually, the best model is determined by the value of a validation metric. We will use the same handler, `Checkpoint`, to save the best model according to the highest validation accuracy:



# Store best model by validation accuracy
best_model_handler = Checkpoint(
    {"model": model},
    save_handler,
    filename_prefix="best",
    n_saved=1,
    score_name="accuracy",
    score_function=Checkpoint.get_default_score_fn("accuracy"),
)
 
evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, best_model_handler)


# ### Setting up TensorBoard as an experiment tracking system

# When running training with different configurations, another common practice is to use an experiment tracking system, for example, TensorBoard, to log parameters and metrics and to compare experiments. We will use the `TensorboardLogger` (https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.contrib.handlers.tensorboard_logger.html#ignite.contrib.handlers.tensorboard_logger.TensorboardLogger) to log the trainer's loss and validation metrics:



 
 
tb_logger = TensorboardLogger(log_dir=output_path)
 
# Attach handler to plot trainer's loss every 100 iterations
tb_logger.attach_output_handler(
    trainer,
    event_name=Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED(every=100),
    tag="training",
    output_transform=lambda loss: {"batch_loss": loss},
)
 
# Attach handler for plotting both evaluators' metrics after every epoch completes
tb_logger.attach_output_handler(
    evaluator,
    event_name=Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED,
    tag="validation",
    metric_names="all",
    global_step_transform=global_step_from_engine(trainer),
)


# ### Executing the PyTorch-Ignite model training code

# The trainer is now set up and ready to be executed. Letâ€™s train the model for five epochs via the `run()` method:



trainer.run(train_loader, max_epochs=5)


# We can start TensorBoard server with
#     tensorboard --logdir='./output'
# and display the dashboard in the browser:
