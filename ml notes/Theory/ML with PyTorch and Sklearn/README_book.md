## Table of Contents and Code Notebooks

**Helpful installation and setup instructions can be found in the [README.md file of Chapter 1](Theory/ML%20with%20PyTorch%20and%20Sklearn/ch01/README.md)**.

**In addition, Zbynek Bazanowski contributed [this helpful guide](supplementary/running-on-colab.pdf) explaining how to run the code examples on Google Colab.**

**Please note that these are just the code examples accompanying the book, which we uploaded for your convenience; be aware that these notebooks may not be useful without the formulae and descriptive text.**
