## 1st video:
- *micrograd* on GitHub: https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd
- jupyter notebooks I built in this video: https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-t...

- its a basic library which have the concept of neural networks.
- it contain 2 main files: `engine` and `nn`:
- `engine` file mainly contain all the mathematics to proceed with operations like backpropagation 
- `nn` just fined the what neurons, layer and mlp (comb. of layers).
- PyTorch and tensors are just pieces where we define to optimize the network and efficiency of whole modelling put together.

Starts with :
- Derivative
