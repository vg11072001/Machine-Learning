 such as the bias-variance trade-off, 
 detecting overfitting and under-fitting, 
 L1/L2 regularization, 
 feature/model selectionâ€¦ 
 Noways DL basics are also a necessity, such as how backpropagation works, 
 choices of optimizers and schedulers, 
 vanishing/exploding gradients and remedies, 
 regularization methods that apply specifically to neural nets, etc. 
 
 Eval metric calculations given true labels and 
 predicted labels, 
 so prepare for the common ones (e.g., AUC, nDCG)
