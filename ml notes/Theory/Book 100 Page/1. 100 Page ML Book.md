# Introduction

### Why Does Model Work on New Data
The reader interested in knowing more about the *learnability* and understanding the close relationship between the model error, the size of the training set, the form of the mathematical equation that defines the model, and the time it takes to build the model is encouraged to read about the *PAC learning*. The **PAC** (for “probably approximately correct”) learning theory helps to analyze whether and under what conditions a learning algorithm will probably output an approximately correct classifier.
