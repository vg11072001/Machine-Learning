# Motivation

> ```How to transition into an MLE? As someone who went through this transition back in school, I hate to discourage people, but it’s also no use being dishonest: Grasping machine learning theory and applying it to production systems takes years of study and experience. Anyone can copy & paste PyTorch code online, but only seasoned ML engineers can trouble-shoot a model that’s not performing as intended. ML engineering is somewhat like medicine in that neural networks are as much an enigma as the human body: Highly specialized knowledge is needed to diagnose a non-working system and prescribe remedies.``` -- yuan meng

In the early stages of a career, being a generalist is often better than being a specialist. Companies tend to prefer generalists because they can adapt to different tasks, fill multiple roles, and quickly adjust to new challenges. For example: - Software Development: A generalist who knows both front-end and back-end development can contribute across the stack. This flexibility makes them valuable to companies with small teams, where hiring someone who can only do one thing might not be practical. - Machine Learning: A generalist familiar with NLP, computer vision, and time-series analysis can handle a variety of data challenges. This adaptability is attractive to companies who wants someone capable of solving diverse problems. - DevOps: A generalist who understands cloud platforms, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines can build and maintain infrastructure more effectively. This broad knowledge is useful for companies looking to streamline deployment and infrastructure management without needing multiple specialists. Specialists, while valuable for deep expertise, might not be as appealing for entry-level roles, as they may lack the broader skills needed to jump into different projects. Being a generalist early on can make you more marketable and allow you to explore what you enjoy before choosing a specific path. [Tweet](https://x.com/drummatick/status/1844621469961392230)

1) Before I give you tips, it's important to know that this thread is for ML engineers and not for ML researchers. ML engineers deal with many concepts of software engineering, that is MLOPS, while ML Researchers job requires them to focus on research area only.
2) As an ML Engineer, you need to have an understanding of how to work with cloud infrastructures like AWS, CI-CD pipelines, GCP, model monitoring, model load and model latency testing, etc.
3) Build one solid end to end project which covers data gathering and preprocessing, model building, implementing CI-CD, creating a docker image and deploying in ECR, which will further deploy that code in EC2, model monitoring, model load testing, model retraining pipeline, etc
4) If working with LLM, finetune open source model and use it to build chatbot or RAG system. It will showcase that you know how to finetune the model for the given use case.
5) Learn fundamentals:- I m not asking you to be maths master, but learn fundamentals like how transformers work. No is going to ask you maths, but they will ask you why you choose this model, that vectordb, why this why that, and you should be able to answer those questions.
6) Try to add more stuffs like Redis session management, cache implementation, short term memory for llm, etc.
---
7) Learn in public:- Optimize your LinkedIn profile and start posting about your project, what are you doing today, where are you stuck and what are the things you implemented today, on LinkedIn and Twitter, without caring for likes and followers, let the algorithm play its part
8) Read research papers:- Don't worry about maths much, but just learn new new stuffs, like how you can improve indexing if needed (ex:- Robert indexing), how you can improve LLM model's answering capabilities (ex:- chain of thoughts).
9) Talk all about this in your interview, show them that you know what you are doing, why you are doing, and you are the person they can rely on.
10) Make word documents and high-level workflows and decorate it in the README file in the github repo.
11) If you just do this much enough, there are very very high probabilities that you will stand apart in this tough market.

 **🌟 The Spectrum of ML Roles**

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad28b56-8168-49eb-aac4-9587ccc62056_1536x1070.png)



](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad28b56-8168-49eb-aac4-9587ccc62056_1536x1070.png)

A small sample of job titles across ML role spectrum. Unfortunately, each company defines these titles differently, so reviewing job descriptions is crucial.

ML roles can vary widely based on their primary technical responsibilities and area of specialization.

**1. Technical Responsibility:**

- **Data Analysis / Modeling:**
    
    - Skills: Data analysis, feature engineering, model development and training, statistical analysis, experiment design.
        
- **ML Infrastructure / Deployment / Scaling :**
    
    - Skills: Training and Inference services, scalability, model deployment, API integration.
        

**2. Area of Specialization:**

- **Generalist:**
    
    - Skills: Work on a variety of problem spaces, employ a broad range of ML techniques, and adapt to different requirements of the team.
        
- **Specialist:**
    
    - Skills: Deep expertise in the chosen domain (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), or industry-specific areas like self-driving cars and robotics), advanced knowledge of domain-specific tools.
        

> **Note**: Careers are dynamic. You may specialize in one area or shift to a generalist role based on company needs and your goals. For example, I began as a software engineer in a Search Ads ML team, then specialized in Search and NLP through side projects.

Example job descriptions with highlighted keywords to identify the core ML responsibilities.

Before diving in preparation strategy, let’s refresh the 4 ML rounds that we discussed in my previous [article](https://mlengineerinsights.substack.com/p/how-i-aced-machine-learning-interviews) (check it out for more details).

**The Four Types of Rounds:**

1. 📚 Machine Learning Breadth: This round tests your broad knowledge across various ML topics.
    
2. 🔍 Machine Learning Depth: This round focuses on specialized topics and detailed case studies, from your past projects and/or specific domain knowledge.
    
3. 🛠️ Machine Learning System Design: This round evaluates your ability to design scalable ML systems.
    
4. 💻 Machine Learning Coding: In this round, you'll tackle coding challenges around basic algorithms.
    

 **🎯 Modifying Your Interview Preparation Strategy**

**Start with the [Fundamentals](https://mlengineerinsights.substack.com/i/146189281/fundamental-topics-all-levels)**, ensure you have a solid grasp of the basics and you can start preparing this even before applying for interviews. This foundation is crucial no matter which ML role or level you're targeting. Now, let’s dive into tailored strategies.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08f884-3541-4830-806c-52016d70c402_694x594.png)



](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08f884-3541-4830-806c-52016d70c402_694x594.png)

My mental model on the most crucial interview rounds based on core ML responsibilities. Note that this doesn't imply that other rounds aren't important, but it provides a rough idea on where to focus your preparation.

 **Tailoring Your Strategy**

**Data/Modeling Roles**

- **Pay attention to team/job-specific fundamentals**. Example, Google Search interview will focus on search-related questions, not computer vision. If unsure, ask the recruiter directly.
    
    - **Examples**:
        
        - For generalist roles requiring **Deep Learning**, understand multi-layer perceptrons, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs.
            
        - For specialist roles like **NLP** positions, familiarize yourself with [word2vec](https://medium.com/@manansuri/a-dummys-guide-to-word2vec-456444f3c673) (asked to me in a ML breadth round for NLP role), [word embeddings, and transformers](https://medium.com/@kalra.rakshit/introduction-to-transformers-and-attention-mechanisms-c29d252ea2c5).
            
- **Research Company Blogs and Papers:** Many companies have ML blogs that provide insights into their work, Some popular blogs I follow:
    
    - [Google AI](https://research.google/blog/), [Pinterest Engineering](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/tagged/machine-learning), [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Netflix Research](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/machine-learning), [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/blog), [AWS ML](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/), [Snapchat Engineering](https://eng.snap.com/blog), [Uber Engineering](https://www.uber.com/en-US/blog/engineering/), [Doordash Eng blog](https://doordash.engineering/category/data-science-and-machine-learning/).
        
    - Articles related to the team/domain you’re interviewing for provide insights into their challenges and potential interview questions. Discussing these topics can also spark valuable conversations with your interviewer.
        
- As roles become more specialized, **the focus shifts heavily toward domain-specific knowledge**. **Note** that most senior roles require some specialization.
    
    > Resources for some common area of specializations:
    > 
    > - **Ranking/Recommendations:** Critical for Search (Google, Amazon, Microsoft Bing, Airbnb), Discovery (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, Netflix), and more. Generally have the most opportunities and jobs availability.
    >     
    >     - For ranking algorithms, see [A Complete Guide for Ranking](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-to-rank-a-complete-guide-to-ranking-using-machine-learning-4c9688d370d4) and [Introduction to Ranking](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-ranking-algorithms-4e4639d65b8#:~:text=Learning%20to%20rank%20(LTR)%20is,based%20on%20a%20feature%20vector).
    >         
    > 
    > - **Ads:** Understand ads specific challenges like calibration and bidding. Check out this article from the [Pinterest Engineering blog](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-use-automl-multi-task-learning-and-multi-tower-models-for-pinterest-ads-db966c3dc99e).
    >     
    > - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand transformers, attention mechanisms, and LLMs. See this [beginner guide on NLP](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/). For LLMs, explore this [detailed guide from Aishwarya Naresh Reganti](https://github.com/aishwaryanr/awesome-generative-ai-guide).
    >     
    > - **Computer Vision:** Understand CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Image representation in features, Object detection and Classification. Check out this [fundamental course](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) from Udacity.
    >     
    

**ML Services and Infrastructure Roles**

- Prepare specifically for the team/company you're interviewing for as interviews are often around company tech stack.
    
- **Highly Recommended Course**: Educative.io’s [ML System design](https://www.educative.io/courses/machine-learning-system-design)
    
    Examples:
    
    - **Streaming Services (e.g., Netflix):** Study video recommendation systems and related questions. Example: Exponent's article on predicting [watch time](https://www.tryexponent.com/courses/ml-system-design/model-predict-netflix-watch-times).
        
    - **Search/Recommendations Roles:** Focus on user content feed recommendations and other common questions such as "Recommend restaurants on a food delivery app" or "Design user feed"
        
        - Recommended: Checkout Eugene Yan's [article](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/system-design-for-discovery/) on recommendations systems.
            
            > _**Tip:** Designing Recommendation systems are frequently asked in ML System design rounds._
            
    - **Ads:** Understand ad ranking and related challenges like multi-stage ranking. Recommended: Snapchat Engineering's [article](https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking) on ad systems.
        
    

**📈 Parting Note: Tracking Your Progress**

As you navigate the journey of preparing for ML interviews, it's essential to track your progress and learnings. Keep a journal or use digital tools to document:

- The previous interview questions
    
- The papers/blogs you've studied
    
- Key bullet points from your research 
    

Consistent tracking not only helps you stay organized but also boosts your confidence as you see your knowledge and skills grow. It took me time to realize its value, but now I consistently maintain a Google Doc for this purpose.

Remember, ML research advances rapidly, and new breakthroughs can change interview questions so keeping track is key.

Good luck with your interview preparation, and keep pushing forward!

2. Programming is the second skill set before jumping into ML algorithms. Machine learning involves a lot of mathematical and statistical concepts, so it’s essential to have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.

- [Google](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/) has good libraries to develop your programming skills.
- [Cracking Coding Interview](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview_189_Progra/LZzjDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) is a great book to develop your programming skills.
- [Intro to Python Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110): it can be any language/course but Python is a well-known programming language to practice ML.
- Develop a basic [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) understanding. An introductory video as follows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0nxCDiD-zg&ab_channel=KevinStratvert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0nxCDiD-zg&ab_channel=KevinStratvert)
- You need to practice to be able to develop your programming skills so [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) are great for this.

3. You’re trusting your math-related skills, then we can start to talk about Machine Learning, and it all starts with basic Machine Learning Algorithms. Moreover, you can start to build up skills in libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and Numpy at this point.

- **Books**
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Python_Data_Science_Handbook/rCmgEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)
- [Approaching Almost Any Machine Learning Problem](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Approaching_Almost_Any_Machine_Learning/ZbgAEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover)
- **Videos**
- [Coursera’s Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction#syllabus)
- [Kaggle’s Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
- **Blogs**
- [Google’s Machine Learning Collection](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/machine-learning/)
- [Zero to Mastery ML](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml)

Also, from now on, Kaggle and Huggingface are where you’re going to spend time building a deeper understanding and practising what you learn.

4.a If your path lies in NLP

- I’m a massive fan of Spacy, and I think you should consider learning it from the following [playlis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnGPv6HnBok&list=PLBmcuObd5An559HbDr_alBnwVsGq-7uTF&ab_channel=Explosion)t.
- [Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky and Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- If you’d like to keep a book, then Natural Language Processing with Python is good.
- [Kaggle’s learning platform for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/natural-language-processing)
- [Huggingface’s learning platform for NLP](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)
- Must-read papers: NLP is extensive, and I personally couldn’t limit it to 10 papers; however, I highly encourage you to read the articles in the [following link](http://masatohagiwara.net/100-nlp-papers/).

4.b If your path lies in Computer Vision, first, you must program using OpenCV. It’s a vision library that’s easy to learn and use.

- [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)
- [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLSVEhWrZWDHQTBmWZufjxpw3s8sveJtnJ&ab_channel=StanfordUniversitySchoolofEngineering)
- [Computer Vision Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7v9EfkjLswLfjcI-qia-Z-e3ntl9l6vp)
- I like the must-read research papers section for computer vision [in the following blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/beginners-guide-to-learn-computer-vision-in-2021-6083ab6de6af).

5. Finally, let’s not forget about deep learning algorithms. While it can be combined with item 4, I prefer to keep it separate to emphasize its significance in modern machine-learning applications.

- I think Misra Turp did a fantastic job with the following video series on YouTube. It is a great place to start learning: [50 Days of Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mph0cWZsoV4&list=PLM8lYG2MzHmQn55ii0duXdO9QSoDF5myF&ab_channel=M%C4%B1sraTurp)
- [Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- Deep Mind and UCL also released a video series on Youtube: [Deep Learning Lecture Series 2020](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/deep-learning-lecture-series-2020)
- Ian Goodfellow’s [Deep Learning](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Deep_Learning/Np9SDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) book
- [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) using TensorFlow

6. While learning is essential, it is also necessary to put that knowledge into practice and showcase your abilities to increase your chances of securing a job. With that in mind, I would strongly advise [participating in a competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and taking a task by joining [Huggingface’s Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JfAtkvEtRb).

7. There is one thing that you should continue even after you land a job following the latest research in your field. And believe it or not, this is not easy to keep up with the literature. There are a couple of places I personally used to follow:

1. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
2. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
3. I also benefit from Huggingface’s blog and task section: [https://huggingface.co/blog?tag=research](https://huggingface.co/blog?tag=research)
4. Another resource is from CohereAI for me to follow: [Best NLP Research Papers in 2022](https://txt.cohere.ai/best-nlp-research-papers-2022/)

 **BONUS**

1. There is a good abstract roadmap to becoming an AI expert is as [follows](http://roadmap%20to%20becoming%20an%20artificial%20intelligence%20expert%20in%202022/).
2. If you’re looking for The Top MLE Interview Questions. [This blog post is still up-to-date](https://aycignl.medium.com/the-top-10-machine-learning-engineer-interview-questions-24e187e3baaa).
3. You can find cheatsheets from Stanford and MIT in various languages, including Turkish, as follows: [https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/)
4. The Youtube channel [StatQuest by Josh Kramer](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) explains concepts in a highly simplified way. I found it hard to concentrate by myself, but it’s different for everybody, so I’m adding to this list.
5. Another Youtube [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3blue1brown) it’s not limited to only stats, math, and ML world but all that entertains the channel owner :)
6. One more step forward and you need to follow the following blog post: [https://jalammar.github.io/](https://jalammar.github.io/)

### How I learned web development, software engineering, & ML

Ever since Cal Newport wrote about how I learned how to code in [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2OKq68X) by reading books and going to a bootcamp (which thousands of people do every year - I'm not special), I've been getting a few emails a week asking for more details. Most often, people ask for the specific books I read as I was preparing, or general advice on breaking into the field. Below is a representative sample. If I sent you this link to you, I hope it's helpful! If you have any further questions, please [email me](mailto:jasoncbenn@gmail.com), and I'll use them to improve this guide.

_"We greatly overestimate what we can do in one year. But we greatly underestimate what is possible for us in five years."_ -Peter Drucker. This guide probably would've scared the shit out of me back in 2013 when I was starting. But it's worth it! Software engineering is creative, intellectually stimulating, high-impact, flexible (you can work on almost any problem you want), more social than people realize (pair programming is great!), you can work outside or abroad, it's well compensated, and it has an unlimited skill ceiling. The last part is the _best_, because if you're more systematic about studying than your peers, then it's just a matter of time before you'll be so in-demand that you'll be able to dictate the terms of your employment such that your lifestyle is however you want it to be. I recommend it to most everyone that thinks they might learn to like it.

 **tl;dr: two steps to software mastery**

> Hi Jason! I've read from Cal Newport's book 'DeepWork' that you already finished reading as many as 18 books in a few weeks/months by the time you attended the notorious Dev boot camp to become a full stack programmer. Could you tell me which are those software books you were reading. I'm looking for a career change into programming, so any inputs you give would give me would surely help me here.

>>>

Hi Yasir! You can do much better than the path I took. I recommend:

1. Do Hack Reactor or Lambda School
2. [teachyourselfcs.com](http://teachyourselfcs.com/)

And get yourself a job at any point after 1.

Good luck 🙂

 **Step 1, in depth: how to become an employable web developer**

> I am Nirmala from Hyderabad, India and I teach programming to children, teenagers and adults who wish to make a career change to programming. I am curious about the methods that you adopted for getting into the deep focus mode, the methods that were briefly described in Cal Newport's book "DeepWork". Would it be possible for you to share the strategy that worked for you? Which language were you trying to learn? What were the books you referred and your learning methodology? Would you be able to share any link that refers to your learning methodology? The reason I am asking you is that the students , particularly the older ones are barely able to remember what was taught which makes them frustrated and slowly, the confidence and self belief ebbs away. Some students have been very successful but I would attribute their success more to their own self-motivation.

>>>

Hi Nirmala! That's incredibly cool, I love what you're doing.

The things that I thought would work for me, that I actually implemented, were to cut myself off from the Internet and try to memorize the syntax and the APIs of the languages (I figured that not having to look things up as often would make programming much faster). Memorizing languages turns out to be a nice benefit but it's not nearly as important as I thought.

The things that I didn't realize would help me at first but that turned out to help a great deal being excited and motivated by fun side projects and reading the code of other people working on similar problems.

As for barely being able to remember what you've learned -- hard for me to prescribe a solution when I'm not sure why they're having a hard time remembering. Are they moving too fast from subject to subject without exercising their fragile new knowledge? Are they not asking "why" often enough? Are they trying to memorize things they don't understand?

And my learning methodology is pretty much all from Cal Newport. So Good They Can't Ignore You changed my whole life, and I liked his earlier work about being a pro college student too. And Deep Work, obviously :)

As for the curriculum I followed, it was kind of a hodgepodge of books - I ended up memorizing Ruby with flashcards and not realizing until much later that I needed to learn JavaScript, for example 🤦‍♂️. Here's the approximate sequence I wish I had done instead, with the % of the time I would recommend spending on each step:

20% PYTHON

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
- Bonus: [Effective Python](https://amzn.to/2ACkoCS)
- Project idea: Battleship in the terminal (here's [mine](https://gist.github.com/JasonBenn/c3410e0100cdeae95b70), written April 2013! One of my first ever programs!!)

5% RELATIONAL DATABASES

- [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197)
- Project: install MySQL, design a relational schema, implement/seed it with raw SQL

5% STATIC SITES

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
- Bonus: [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)
- Project idea: implement one or two of your favorite effects from [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops)

25% SERVER-SIDE RENDERING WEBAPPS

- the Django equivalent of the Rails Tutorial, although ideally it would be for something simpler than Django, like Flask. Don't know of a good resource.
- Project idea: build simple Reddit

20% JAVASCRIPT

- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- Project idea: Snake in the browser in an HTML canvas

25% CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING WEBAPPS

- Learn React, but... ugh, every tutorial also includes Webpack, ES2017, Redux, etc, etc, etc. By the time you get to this point, anything I recommend would be out of date, so just email me for recommendations.
- Project idea: any website you want!

Now you know enough to be a web developer! Your last step is to land a job, and for that you need to learn how to crush your technical interviews, and for that, there's nothing better than [Bradfield's one-month course on data structures and algorithms](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/algorithms/).

_Then, after a 6-12 months of work experience as a web developer:_

2 YEARS COMPUTER SCIENCE

- [https://teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

At this point you'll be good enough for an intermediate role at any job you want.

Cheers,

- Jason

 **Step 2, in depth: how to master software engineering**

> "My name is Jonathan and I am a junior developer. I am currently reading Cal Newports book and found your part to be really relatable and great. I'd like to ask some questions if you wouldnt mind answering them. As a junior developer what do you think is a priority in becoming employable asap? If you could go back in time and give advice to yourself when you were still learning programming what would it be? Lastly, what resources (books, online courses, etc.) Old or new would you deem as fundamental for any developer. I believe I pickup on things well but I still feel like I'm lacking the knowledge and understanding that CS graduates would have as I'm not doing a comp sci degree. If you cant answer them all thats fine. Any advice would be tremendous, I'm just really keen to absorb any useful information! Kind regards, Jonathan.

>>>

Hi Jonathan!

Glad you enjoyed the book. Kinda couldn't believe it when he featured me like that, I just responded to a mailing list blast and he interviewed me over Skype for an hour.

The long slow path to employability is through computer science. There are lots of junior developers with basic web development skills but very little of the foundational skills that you'll need for a long, satisfying, and stable career. Fortunately, you now have the perfect resource for getting there! Rejoice, it's [teachyourselfcs.com](http://teachyourselfcs.com/). Give yourself 2-3 years to work though that list and you'll be golden. If you're interviewing now, then just focus on algorithms and data structures, as those will most help you during interview time. I personally found this list really fun and interesting - I finally understood all the terms and concepts that people at the office were talking about! Learning computer science after being a working programmer is like being prescribed glasses for the first time and going outside and noticing all the leaves on the trees. You just see and understand so much _more._

Related: if I could go back and give myself advice, it would be to stop learning the wrong things (mostly the APIs of JavaScript frameworks, new languages, or the newest hottest trends). This was just a misunderstanding of what it means to be a good software engineer.

Oh look, I already answered #3! You're welcome. I'm always super happy to share that resource because it's just so good. If you're in SF, you should consider taking the Bradfield CS courses too, it's the same content but with other students. I've now taken 6 and they've all leveled me up as a developer. Try to get a job and persuade your employer to pay for them. Once you're done with interviewing, here's the best order to take them in:

- [Computer Architecture](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/architecture/)
- [Networking](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/networking/)
- [Databases](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/databases/)
- [Operating Systems](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/operating-systems/)
- [Distributed Systems](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/distributed-systems/)

[Compilers](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/languages/) and [Mathematics for Computing](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/math/) are both nice-to-haves, but not nearly as critical as the above 5.

Cheers, good luck, and keep at it, this is worth it--

- Jason

 **Bonus! Step 3: learn machine learning!**

Things I did, marked with ✨ if I recommend them or 💩 if I don't:

- ✨✨ fast.ai part 1
- ✨ fast.ai part 2
- ✨ The [Deep Learning book](https://amzn.to/2KqO45I)
- Stanford's CS231n, CS224n, or CS229, whichever is relevant to you
- ✨ The [_homeworks_](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/) for CS231n, CS224n, or CS229
- Read a bunch of academic papers
- ✨✨ Start a [reading club](http://medium.com/paper-club) to read a bunch of academic papers (here's a repo with my [notes](https://github.com/JasonBenn/deep-learning-paper-notes) for 100+)
- ✨ Learn linear algebra from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc)
- Brush up on calculus, helpful for:
- Implement softmax, the sigmoid function, backprop, and other neural net components (critical if you want to do research)
- ✨ Implement a basic neural net, a CNN, an RNN, and a GAN
- ✨ Go to NIPS
- 💩 Andrew Ng's Coursera course
- Reimplemented a few landmark papers (also critical if you're going into research)
- ✨ Even better: [Depth First Learning](http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/) tutorials that align with your interests
- For ML: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://amzn.to/2ObJCtD)
- ✨✨ Way better version of the above: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow](https://amzn.to/2OKE2PZ).

This path was a bit muddled because I didn't realize until halfway through that there are two paths in "machine learning": there's _deep learning_, which involves neural nets and is likely the new hotness you've been hearing all about; and then there's _machine learning_, AKA data science, which is decidedly less sexy but more universally useful. I learned both, and guess which one I spend all my time on at Sourceress? Data science. Don't worry, you still get to use neural nets.

**tl;dr:**

If your goal is computer vision, then do fast.ai 1 and 2, half of the deep learning book, and CS231n.

If your goal is AI research but you don't want to get a PhD, then do all of the above. Once you've implemented 3 important papers and can pass the Google software engineering interview then you can get a job at Google Brain as a Research Software Engineer.

If your goal is machine learning, then just do [Machine Learning Engineering in 10 Weeks](https://jasonbenn.com/how-i-went-from-finance-ai/machine-learning-engineering-in-10-weeks-curriculum-v1).


### Machine Learning Roadmap mrdbourke [link](https://github.com/mrdbourke/machine-learning-roadmap)

This blog [Link](https://www.mrdbourke.com/ml-resources/)
The following are in the order I'd recommend them. I've personally taken or have been through or still go through many of them.

Not all are necessary.

Pick and choose whatever sparks your curiosity the most.

They are **code and beginner-focused**. If you're new to the field of machine learning, this page is for you.

For math, use a combination of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/?ref=mrdbourke.com), [3Blue1Brown videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&ref=mrdbourke.com) and the [Math for Machine Learning book](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf?ref=mrdbourke.com). [Matrix multiplication](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html?ref=mrdbourke.com), [linear algebra](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-linear-algebra/?ref=mrdbourke.com) and [calculus](https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculus-in-machine-learning-why-it-works/?ref=mrdbourke.com) are enough to get started.

> **Note:** All paid resources in this article have affiliate links. This means if you spend money on something, I'll get a small portion of the funds. This doesn't change the price for you at all but does help me feed my family and keep making things, so thank you.


**Fundamental Python Skills**

If you know nothing about machine learning or programming, you should start by learning Python code. If you already know Python code (3-6 months hands-on experience) skip to the next step.

Python is the dominant programming language for modern machine learning and deep learning. There are many languages you can write machine learning code in but worry about these later (it will be rare that you'll need them).

To learn Python, I'd recommend:

- [**Zero to Mastery Python Course**](https://dbourke.link/ztm-python-course?ref=mrdbourke.com) - taught by Andrei Neogoie (50% of the machine learning course we teach together), so if you like this style, you'll like the machine learning course.
- [**Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-python?ref=mrdbourke.com) - A fantastic introduction to the wonderful world of Python
- [**realpython.com**](https://realpython.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com) - My favourite reference point for anything and everything Python, you'll probably find yourself here many times as you keep learning more about Python.
- [**freeCodeCamp's Python course on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ref=mrdbourke.com) - A free introduction to Python all in one YouTube video.

 **Ground Floor Data Science and Machine Learning Skills**

Once you've got some experience writing Python code, it's time to start writing machine learning specific code and getting familiar with the data science stack of: pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, matplotlib (if these mean nothing to you now, don't worry, you'll learn them as you go).

To learn ground floor machine learning skills, I'd go through:

- [**Zero to Mastery Data Science and Machine Learning Course**](https://dbourke.link/ZTMmlcourse?ref=mrdbourke.com) - I teach this course and I built it directly using the knowledge I'd learned working as a junior machine learning engineer.
- [**Data Science with Python on Coursera**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-data-science-python?ref=mrdbourke.com) - I originally used this course to learn about pandas and different data science techniques when I first started learning about machine learning, it's still world-class.
- [Theory] [**Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-machine-learning?ref=mrdbourke.com) - This is the OG (original gangster) machine learning course, taught using MatLab code but all of the theory still remains (I'd personally watch the videos and skip the coding assignments or do them with Python instead).
- [Overview] **[Machine Learning Roadmap 2023](https://youtu.be/pHiMN_gy9mk?ref=mrdbourke.com)** - A birds-eye view of many of the different concepts in machine learning all gathered in one video and interactive roadmap.

 **Level 1 Deep Learning**

### The fundamentals

Now you've got experience writing machine learning code, it's time to move on to deep learning.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that currently powers many of the world's most powerful machine learning-powered applications (self-driving cars would not be possible without deep learning).

Start with these two foundation courses to get an overview of what deep learning is and what it can be used for, the next list of courses will be code-focused.

- [**AI for Everyone on Coursera**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-ai-for-everyone?ref=mrdbourke.com) - Get started understanding what is AI in a broad sense and then understand what it can and cannot do. This course will help give you an overview of AI in a less technical sense but still covers important ideas of what it takes to build an AI & machine learning-powered project.
- [**MIT Introduction to Deep Learning**](http://introtodeeplearning.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com) - A video series containing possibly the best high-level and deep-dive introduction to deep learning on the internet.

 **Level 2 Deep Learning**

### Coding and training models

Now you've got an idea of what deep learning is, now it's time to put it into practice and start writing code to run deep learning algorithms.

If you've done the previous courses and steps, you'll have more than enough prerequisites to get going with the following.

- **[Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse?ref=mrdbourke.com)** or **[Zero to Mastery PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://dbourke.link/ZTMPyTorch?ref=mrdbourke.com)** – Learn to build state-of-the-art neural networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch code-first. This course is taught in side by side style, meaning I write code, you write code.
- [**Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-deep-learning?ref=mrdbourke.com) - I used these courses to learn about deep learning when I first got started with data science. They're some of the highest quality on the internet.
- [**fast.ai**](https://www.fast.ai/?ref=mrdbourke.com) (all resources) – Whenever I want a no-BS approach to something new in the world of AI, I look up what Jeremy Howard has to say about it. Because of his independent viewpoints, he's only focused on the best of the best. And because of this, the fast.ai courses and software are sensational.

 
 **Level 3 Deep Learning**

### Getting your models into the hands of others

Alright, you've written some deep learning code and you've got an idea of where machine learning can be used in the world.

Time to use your skills to build something people can put their hands on.

This is what people mean when they say "deploy your models", deploying means putting your code somewhere other people can use it such as an application or website.

And to add to the confusion, these steps are often referred to as full-stack deep learning, MLOps (machine learning operations) and machine learning system design.

For these, you'll want to look into:

- **[Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com)** – Covers many of the concepts you'll need to know when dealing with machine learning applications (more than just training a model on an existing dataset).
- [**Made with ML's MLOps**](https://madewithml.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com#mlops) by Goku Mohandas – A comprehensive text-based course that goes through many of the steps in a full-stack machine learning project.
- **Chip Huyen's [Machine Learning System Design Course (CS329s)](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/?ref=mrdbourke.com)** –Teaches you how to think about designing a machine learning system (where does the data come in? right to where does the data go out?). I teach a [deployment tutorial](https://youtu.be/fw6NMQrYc6w?ref=mrdbourke.com) in this course.
- [**Designing Machine Learning Systems book by Chip Huyen**](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969?ref=mrdbourke.com) — If you want to build an ML system, it’d be good to know how others have done it. Chip’s book focuses less on creating a single machine learning model (though there’s plenty of content on that in the book) but rather on creating a cohesive ML system. It covers everything from data engineering to model building to model deployment (online and offline) to model monitoring. Even better, it’s a joy to read, you can tell the book is written by a writer (Chip has previously authored several books).

 **Other important developer skills**

The world of software is large.

But once you get an idea of how different languages interact with each other and how different systems communicate, you can start to build an idea of what you might need to do to create the thing you want.

The following resources will help fill in many of the gaps you might run into.

If you're like me, you want to build applications other people can use, the following are resources that have helped me learn how to do such a thing.

- [**freeCodeCamp's materials**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/?ref=mrdbourke.com) – Especially those on web development, databases and [version control (Git and GitHub)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uszj_k0DGsg&ref=mrdbourke.com).
- [**The Missing Semester of Your CS Education**](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/?ref=mrdbourke.com) – Covers many of the tools you'll use every day as a developer but aren't often taught in computer science courses (think the command line, version control, shell tools, debugging).
- [**Zero to Mastery Web Developer Course**](https://dbourke.link/ztm-web-developer?ref=mrdbourke.com) – Taught to over 100,000 students worldwide by one of the best technology educators Andrei Neagoie, this course will help you learn how the internet works and build applications online that millions of others can use.
- **[Zero to Mastery SQL Course](https://dbourke.link/ztm-sql-course?ref=mrdbourke.com)** – SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's the language that powers many databases around the world. This website you're reading runs off MySQL (a flavour of SQL). If you're going to be getting deep into machine learning, you'll likely come across SQL since it's so intertwined with data and as you'll find out: no data = no machine learning.

**Getting a job**

Start the job before you have it.

Courses teach foundational knowledge, building your own projects and sharing them with the world help you learn specific knowledge (knowledge that can't be taught).

For more on this, I'd suggest the following:

- Read ["How should a beginner data scientist like me get experience?"](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/) by myself.
- [Machine Learning Interviews book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Chip Huyen for how to prepare for machine learning interviews (though this is quite extensive, focus on less but better).
- See Chip Huyen's blog post [on writing a resume](https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/24/what-we-look-for-in-a-candidate.html?ref=mrdbourke.com), which mainly focuses on machine learning but the tips are almost universal for any tech role.

But even better than a job (and I’m _very_ biased here), start a business. Or get a job, learn the fundamentals + field-specific skills, get out and then start something of your own.

The world needs more people who bet on themselves.

## "What about books?"

![my favourite machine learning books (stacked on my desk)](https://www.mrdbourke.com/content/images/2021/10/2021-10-12-ml-books.png)

My favourite machine learning books.

I've got the following books on my desk and refer to them regularly.

- [**Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow**](https://amzn.to/3aYexF2?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Aurelien Geron
- [**The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book**](http://bit.ly/100pagemlbook?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Andriy Burkov [[Read online](http://themlbook.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com)]
- [**Machine Learning Engineering**](https://amzn.to/3mbelZq?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Andriy Burkov [[Read online](http://mlebook.com/?ref=mrdbourke.com)]
- [**Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch**](https://amzn.to/2YDxBrI?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Jeremy Howard & Sebastian Gugger [[Read online](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook?ref=mrdbourke.com)]
- [**Mathematics for Machine Learning**](https://amzn.to/3lwgoJu?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Marc Deisenroth, A. Faisal & Cheng Ong [[Read online](https://mml-book.github.io/?ref=mrdbourke.com)]

 **"How should I learn all of this?"**

Create your own path. Everyone learns differently.

You can read my articles on how I learned for an idea but really, that's just me and my style, better to create your own.

- [5 Beginner-Friendly Steps to Learn Machine Learning](https://www.mrdbourke.com/5-beginner-friendly-steps-to-learn-machine-learning/) ([video](https://youtu.be/IMMDPzECrf0?ref=mrdbourke.com))
- [How I'd start learning machine learning again, 3 years in](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-id-start-learning-machine-learning-again-3-years-in/) ([video](https://youtu.be/cZ2HCclgQ-g?ref=mrdbourke.com))
- [6 techniques that help me study machine learning five days per week](https://www.mrdbourke.com/6-techniques-which-help-me-study-machine-learning-five-days-per-week/) ([video](https://youtu.be/hsQ9efb6a7c?ref=mrdbourke.com))
- [Thinking of self-studying machine learning? Remind yourself of these 6 things](https://www.mrdbourke.com/thinking-of-self-studying-machine-learning-remind-yourself-of-these-6-things/) ([video](https://youtu.be/MD3R9yatou0?ref=mrdbourke.com))
- [12 things I learned during my first year as a machine learning engineer](https://www.mrdbourke.com/12-things-i-learned-during-my-first-year-as-a-machine-learning-engineer/)

Eugene Yan also has a great article on how to learn beyond MOOCs (massive online open courses). It echoes much of my sentiment on learning online: use courses for foundations and then use your own projects to build specific knowledge.

See [You Don't Really Need Another MOOC](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/?ref=mrdbourke.com) by Eugene Yan for more.

Knowledge is best experienced shared, write down what you learn and share it with others.

Start your own blog for words and make a GitHub profile for code, these will become your own corner of the internet where people can find and learn more about you.

Keep learning, keep creating.

Treat it like a dance, follow your curiosity and hop from one idea to the next.
